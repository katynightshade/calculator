# Calculator
Preview Link: https://katynightshade.github.io/calculator/

**Technologies Used:**
-HTML5
-CSS3
-Vanilla JavaScript

**Project Description:**
I will be creating a fully functional calculator, to include basic HTML, responsive CSS, and well-executing JavaScript. My JavaScript in this project will include DOM manipulation, operational on-screen buttons, and keyboard support. This is the culminating project for The Odin Project's Foundations pathway. 

**Reflection:**
I feel proud of this project. It is by far my best JavaScript. I did slip up a bit with my Git workflow; at one point I was getting really into my JavaScript and forgot to commit a big chunk of code. The logic needed for this project was the most challenging part. I struggled for a long time until I used resources that are availabel to me. I used Google frequently and didn't shy away from viewing other people's code and seeing if they had ideas that would help me with my logic. Something I feel that I can get better at is deleting old code, instead of commenting it out, and viewing my previous commits to find old code if I need it.

**Future Upgrades:**
This project needs a bit more work for responsive CSS, but other than that, I really like the way that this project looks. I plan to add a history log to the page. I will likely start this task out by getting the history log functioning in the console log, then adding an HTML element to push the calculator's history to. As far as bugs that need to be corrected, there needs to be a character limit in both display divs; as of right now, the text continues either off-screen (bottom display) or wraps into the keypad (top display). I also need to clear all displays when the equal sign is used; the calculator gets quite buggy if it's not emptied before it moves to the next algorithm.
Eventually, I hope to add a link out to a scientific calculator with the same format. I also hope to change the current calculator to allow for longer problems to be solved using the order of operations, instead of only solving simple, two-part problems and using the answer for the next problem.
