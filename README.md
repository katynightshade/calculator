# calculator

I will be creating a fully functional calculator, to include basic HTML, responsive CSS, and well-executing JavaScript. My JavaScript in this project will include DOM manipulation, operational on-screen buttons, and keyboard support. This is the culminating project for The Odin Project's Foundations pathway.
